<h1>The Best Movies According to Earnest</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>This is my favourite move, it highlights the importance of hope.</p>
<h3>Hard Target</h3>
<p>As always Jean-Claude van Damme is very feisty here.</p>
<h3>A Time to Kill</h3>
<p>One of my favourite legal dramas.</p>
